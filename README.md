# shared-component-starter

This is a starter template (with a single example component) that builds a demo page displaying the component and handles publishing to npm and Github Pages (now a *Pro* feature).

See a full rundown and tutorial by Brad Stiff [on Medium](https://medium.com/dailyjs/building-a-react-component-with-webpack-publish-to-npm-deploy-to-github-guide-6927f60b3220).

## Main commands

- *npm start* to view your demo locally (on :3001)
- *npm publish* to push to npm (requires registration and auth)
- *npm run build* to create examples/dist
- *npm run publish-demo* to publish to Github Pages (if you're paying for it)

Publishing to npm is effective immediate (*remember to bump up versions in package.json!*), but Github Pages can take up to 20 minutes to take effect.
